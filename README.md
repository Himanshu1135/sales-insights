Firstly, the raw data was extracted from various sources and consolidated into a centralized database. SQL queries were then used to extract and transform the data into a suitable format for analysis. This process involved cleaning, filtering, and aggregating the data to generate meaningful insights.

Next, data modeling techniques were employed to create a data model that accurately represents the relationships between the different sales metrics. This model helped to provide a deeper understanding of the data and enable more complex analysis.

Finally, the insights generated from the analysis were visualized using Power BI. Various visualizations such as charts, graphs, and tables were created to communicate the key findings to stakeholders. Interactive dashboards were also developed, allowing users to explore the data further and gain deeper insights.

Overall, the Sale Insight project provided stakeholders with a clear understanding of their sales performance and identified areas for improvement. The use of SQL, data modeling, and Power BI allowed for a more comprehensive analysis and effective communication of insights to stakeholders.
